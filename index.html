    <h1> Distribution:Level, Spread, Shape, and Outliers. </h1>
    <h1> Distribution</h1>
    <p> Distribution is how the data is given whithin a graph. The data is usually a sample of a population which when visualizing needs 
      to be distributed inside a graph to help the audience understand what the data means.
    </p>
    <h1> Level </h1> 
    <p> Level is the mean or median, depending on the data, which can describe the Standard deviation from the middle of the distribution.
      Knowing the level helps the audience know understand how the rest of the data deviates from the middle. Furthermore, the level can 
      help give the Z-score by using the mean and standard deviation (both found using the level). Refer to the figure.
    </p>
    <h1> Spread </h1>
   <p> Distribution can be described when using the range. Range is how much the data varies, such as, the maximum minus the minimum.
      Therefore, the range of the data can describe how it was distributed inside the graph or plot being used, as seen in the figure.
    </p>
    <h1> Shape </h1> 
    <p> When using shape to describe a distribution it's in reference to the look of the data on the given graph. Shape tells the audience
      whether there may be a skew in the data or not. Skew is when the data is not a normal distribution, and there are factors which
      cause the data to shift. However, if the data is symmetrical then a normal distribution is present.
    </p>
    <h1> Outliers </h1>
    <p> Outliers effect the level, shape, and spread in the distribution of data. In the context of the three elements, the median may 
      be used if enough outliers curve the graph to be skewed, and the mean may be used if the outliers play no drastic effect on the data
      resulting in a normal distribution. Futhermore, the spread of the data may increase if outliers are present or decrease if absent.
